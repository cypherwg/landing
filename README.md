## What the hack is CYPHER?

CYPHER isn't just another blockchain tool. It's a goddamn revolution disguised as code. We're not here to play nice with outdated data systems. We're here to obliterate them.

## Why CYPHER?

Because once you taste true data liberation, you can't go back. It's like asking why oxygen after you've been drowning.
