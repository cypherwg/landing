# Key Capabilities

## Real-time Data Processing

Windexer captures and processes Solana blockchain data in real-time, ensuring that users always have access to the most up-to-date information. Our system can handle Solana's high throughput, processing thousands of transactions per second with minimal latency.

- **Ultra-low Latency**: Process transactions within milliseconds of their occurrence
- **High Throughput**: Handle Solana's 65,000+ TPS with ease
- **Adaptive Scaling**: Automatically adjust resources to manage traffic spikes

## Comprehensive Data Indexing

We index all on-chain data, providing a complete view of the Solana ecosystem:

- Account states and historical changes
- Detailed transaction information and execution logs
- Program instructions and invocations, including inner instructions
- Token transfers, balances, and metadata
- NFT creation, transfers, and attribute updates
- Governance proposals and voting activities

## Advanced Querying

Our flexible query interfaces allow for complex data retrieval and analysis:

- **GraphQL API**: Nested and relational queries for efficient data fetching
- **Full-text Search**: Quickly find relevant transactions, accounts, or tokens
- **Time-range Queries**: Analyze historical data with precision
- **Aggregation Functions**: Perform on-chain analytics with ease
- **Custom Filters**: Create complex queries to extract specific data sets

## Scalability and Performance

Cypher Indexer is designed to scale horizontally, allowing it to grow with the Solana network:

- Distributed processing and storage across multiple nodes
- Automatic sharding and load balancing for optimal performance
- Query optimization for large datasets
- Efficient data compression to reduce storage requirements
